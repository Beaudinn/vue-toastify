# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome**.

Contributions are done via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/nandi95/vue-toastify).


## Pull Requests

- **Keep the same style** - make sure eslint passing

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` the relevant section on the documentation site are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider the version number** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/).

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask to pull from your master branch.

- **Consider Vue version** - Make sure to update the requirement in the `README.md.` and/or employ different strategies for different versions.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure your commits message means something


## Running Demo App

**Happy coding**!
